    "For most real world applications we do not have enough labelled images to train a large neural network from scratch. Instead we can use a pre-trained network as a feature transformer and train a smaller model (or even just a logistic regression) on the output of the pre-trained network.\n",

    "\n",
    "The task for this question is to build a classifier that can tell road bikes from mountain bikes. Start with using a pre-trained network as feature transformer and logistic regression as classifier on the output of the pretrained network. Once this works you can experiment with extracting features from earlier layers of the pre-trained network, compare your performance to a small network trained from scratch, try to beat your neural net by extracting features by hand and feeding them to a random forest, increasing your dataset size by [augmenting the data](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/), etc.\n",

The network was trained on 100 images from a catalog which show bikes on a white background.
